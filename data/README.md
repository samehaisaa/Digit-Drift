# Data Storage

The data is stored in the form of `dataset/subfolders`. Each folder within the subfolders is named according to the label it represents. For example, the folder named `1` contains all images of the digit `1`. There are a total of 10 folders inside the `dataset` folder, each corresponding to a digit from `0` to `9`.
